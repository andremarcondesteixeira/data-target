<h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
<h2>By Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
    And sorry I could not travel both<br />
    And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
    And looked down one as far as I could<br />
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;
</p>
<p>
    Then took the other, as just as fair,<br />
    And having perhaps the better claim,<br />
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br />
    Though as for that the passing there<br />
    Had worn them really about the same,
</p>
<p>
    And both that morning equally lay<br />
    In leaves no step had trodden black.<br />
    Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
    I doubted if I should ever come back.
</p>
<p>
    I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
    Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br />
    I took the one less traveled by,<br />
    And that has made all the difference.
